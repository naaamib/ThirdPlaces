            A third place is a location for people to socialize and exist outside of outside of work and home. Typically
            these
            places consist of malls, cafes, and bookstores, but as a cosequence of an anti-youth culture, a global
            pandemic
            and late stage capatalism, these places are hard to come by. Nowadays many people spend their day-to-day in
            an
            endless cylce of going to work, then home, then back to work which has resulted in what the surgeon general
            refers
